---++ Description

This plugin redesigns the way how users interact with topics and attachments in various ways:

   * improved attachment handling
   * improved visuals displaying !DataForms
   * improved integration of Foswiki:Extensions/MetaCommentPlugin and Foswiki:Extensions/FlexPaperPlugin

Other features are:

   * cross-browser compatible bulk upload of multiple files
   * bulk actions on attachments: delete, move, hide, download as zip archive, create image gallery, insert links
   * thumbnail and lightbox preview of image attachments
   * easy renaming of attachments using modal dialogs
   * easy access to previous revisions of attachments
   * loading the list of attachments via ajax not to slow down display of topics with lots of attachments
   * filtering and pagination for topics with a lot of attachments
   * drag & drop upload for browsers supporting it (currently firefox and chrome only)

---++ Settings
To activate you'll need to add =topicinteraction= to your SKIN path setting in your !SitePreferences, like

<verbatim>
    * Set SKIN = topicinteraction, pattern
</verbatim>

Use the =insidetab= setting of !MetaCommentPlugin to render comments inside a tab at the bottom of the page:

<verbatim>
    * Set SKIN = topicinteraction, metacomment, pattern
    * Set DISPLAYCOMMENTS = on
    * Set COMMENTFORMAT = insidetab
</verbatim>

Note you won't need using Foswiki:Extensions/NatSkin as that's integrated automatically.

---++ Creating a link to an attachment

!TopicInteractionPlugin extens the standard way of inserting links to an attachment. Instead of only distinguishing between images and other kinds
of attachments you may now specify different code to be inserted into the topic based on the mime type of an attachment. You may specify a set of
various preference settings. The actual setting being used is chosen in the given precedence:

   1 =ATTACHED_&lt;file-extension>_FORMAT= 
   1 =ATTACHED_&lt;mime-type>_FORMAT= 
   1 =ATTACHEDIMAGEFORMAT= (provided for compatibility, left out in below examples)
   1 =ATTACHED_FILE_FORMAT=
   1 =ATTACHEDFILELINKFORMAT= (provided for compatibility, left out in below examples)

(=&lt;file-extension>= and =&lt;mime-type>= are uppercase). For example, when inserting a link to an attachment named =screenshot.png= the following
settings are looked up:

   1 =ATTACHED_PNG_FORMAT=
   1 =ATTACHED_IMAGE_FORMAT=
   1 =ATTACHED_FILE_FORMAT=

The one first found is used. When looking up the link format based on the mime type, the actual _mime type group_ is used, such as
=IMAGE=, =VIDEO=, =TEXT=, =AUDIO= etc just to name the most interesting ones. There are a couple of more mime types that are grouped together
in a meaningful way to form the group =DOCUMENT= which are =application/.*(document|msword|msexcel|rtf).*=, as well as =PDF= which are =application/pdf=
and =application/postscript=. 

For example the following settings might be quite useful:

Using [[https://foswiki.org/Extensions/DocumentViewerPlugin][DocumentViewerPlugin]]:

<verbatim class="tml">
   * Set ATTACHED_ODT_FORMAT = $percntDOCUMENTVIEWER{"$filename"}$percnt
   * Set ATTACHED_PDF_FORMAT = $percntDOCUMENTVIEWER{"$filename"}$percnt
</verbatim>

Using [[https://foswiki.org/Extensions/ImagePlugin][ImagePlugin]]:

<verbatim class="tml">
   * Set ATTACHED_IMAGE_FORMAT = $percntIMAGE{"$filename" size="200" caption="$comment"}$percnt 
</verbatim>

Using [[https://foswiki.org/Extensions/MediaElementPlugin][MediaElementPlugin]]:

<verbatim class="tml">
   * Set ATTACHED_VIDEO_FORMAT = $percntVIDEO{"$filename"}$percnt
   * Set ATTACHED_AUDIO_FORMAT = $percntAUDIO{"$filename"}$percnt
</verbatim>

Using !WebDAVContrib (please adjust the webdav://wiki/dav prefix to your needs):

<verbatim class="tml">
   * Set OFFICELINK = <a href='webdav://wiki/dav/%WEB%/%TOPIC%/%DEFAULT{default=""}%' class='jqWebDAVLink' title='Edit Office Attachment' rel='nofollow'>%DEFAULT{default=""}%</a>
   * Set ATTACHED_DOCUMENT_FORMAT = $percntOFFICELINK{"$filename"}$percnt
   * Set WEBDAV_OFFICE_SUITE = msoffice, libreoffice or openoffice (defaults to settings in =configure=)
</verbatim>


The =..._FORMAT= strings support the following variables:

   * =$filename=: the name of the file
   * =$fileext=: the filename extension (string following the last period, if present) or an empty string.
   * =$fileurl=: URL of the filename
   * =$comment=: the file comment from the upload dialog
   * =$size=: the filesize (=%<nop>ATTACHEDIMAGEFORMAT%= only)
   * =$width=: image width
   * =$height=: image width
   * =$date=: modification date of attachment
   * Any standard [[FormatTokens][formatting tokens]]: =$percnt=, =$dollar=, etc.
    
---+++ Incompatibilities

There is a significant difference how Foswiki's natively processes =ATTACHEDFILEFORMAT= settings and the way !TopicInteractionPlugin does. 

   * Any macro expression __must always be escaped__ using standard format tokens =$percnt= and =$dollar=. As such previous settings might be incompatible with !TopicInteractionPlugin
     settings of the same kind.
   * The __time format specifiers are not supported__. Use =$date= instead.


---++ Syntax

!TopicInteractionPlugin implements some macros to actually implement the user interface. These macros can be used for other purposes too of course.

---+++ ATTACHMENTS
List all attachments of a given topic. Without any parameters it displays a
table of attachments similar to the one generated by the templates at the bottom
of a topic. There are a couple of parameters that take regular expressions to
limit the number of attachments to be listed.

*Syntax:*
| *%<nop>ATTACHMENTS%, %<nop>ATTACHMENTS{"&lt;topic>" ...}%* ||
| ="&lt;topic>"= | topic with attachments to be included | 
| =attr="..."= | match the attachments' attribute |
| =autoattached="yes,no,undef"= | limit attachments to those that are (not) autoattached |
| =casesensitive="on/off"= | specify string comparison mode when filtering attachments, defaults to =on= | 
| =comment="..."= | match the attachments' comment |
| =maxdate="..."= | specify latest attachment |
| =maxsize="..."= | specify biggest attachment |
| =mindate="..."= | specify earliest attachment |
| =minsize="..."= | specify smallest attachment |
| =names="..."= | regular expression matching the name of attachments to be include in the list |
| =user="..."= | regular expression matching the attachments' user who uploaded it |
| =include="..."= | general regular expression that the name, user, comment and attributes must match |
| =exclude="..."= | general regular expression that the name, user, comment and attributes must _not_ match |
| =footer="..."= | format string appended to the result |
| =format="..."= | how to format each attachment |
| =header="..."= | format string prefixing the resulting output |
| =separator="..."= | format string put between each formatted attachment  |
| =hidenull="on,off"= | hide/display the empty result; only the header and the footer are included \
                if set to "off" and there's no attachment at the given topic |
| =nullformat="..."= | format string to be used when no attachments have been found and =hidenull= is switched off | 
| =nullheader="..."= | header string to be used when no attachments have been found and =hidenull= is switched off | 
| =nullfooter="..."= | footer string to be used when no attachments have been found and =hidenull= is switched off | 
| =sort="name,date,size,user,comment,comment:name,random,type"= | sort results by specified property |
| =reverse="on/off"= | enable reverse sorting |
| =limit="..."= | limit the number of attachments to the given number; by default show all |
| =dateformat="..."= | custom date format string, defaults to the system's default date format |

The following variables can be used in the format parameter:
   * $attr: the attributes
   * $autoattached: the autoattach flag
   * $comment: the comment field
   * $date(&lt;format>): the attachment date using &lt;format> to format the date
   * $date: the attachment date
   * $delete: the action to delete the current attachment
   * $deleteUrl: the url used in the delete action
   * $extension: file extension of this attachment
   * $hidden: =0= or =1= depending on the file being hidden or not
   * $icon: img tag representing the filetype, this is either a matching [[System.DocumentGraphics][document graphics]] or using [[https://foswiki.org/Extensions/MimeIconPlugin][MimeIconPlugin]] if installed
   * $iconUrl: the url pointing to the icon used in the img tag
   * $index: the position index of the attachment in the result
   * $move: the action to move the current attachment
   * $moveUrl: the url used in the move action
   * $name: the name of the attachment
   * $path: the path property of the attachment
   * $props: the action to change the properties of the current attachment
   * $propsUrl: the url used in the props action
   * $size: the size in bytes 
   * $sizeH: file size in a humanized display (using KB, MB, GB, etc) as needed
   * $sizeK: the size in kilo bytes 
   * $sizeM: the size in mega bytes 
   * $sizeG: the size in giga bytes 
   * $topic: the name of the topic of whose attachments are listed
   * $url: the attachments url
   * $urlpath: the attachments urlpath
   * $user: the user that uploaded the attachment
   * $web: the web name of the current topic
   * $webdav: the action to edit the current attachment using the Foswiki:Extensions/WebDavPlugin
   * $webdavUrl: the url used in the webdav action
   * $wikiuser: the user's home topic that recently changed the current attachment
   * $movedfrom: location from where an attachment was moved from to the current location
   * $movedfromweb: web part
   * $movedfromtopic: topic part
   * $movedfromname: name of the original attachment

   * $movedtoweb: web part
   * $movedtotopic: topic part
   * $movedtoname: name part
   * $movedby: name of the user that moved the attachment
   * $movedwhen: date when the attachment was moved
   * $movedwhen(&lt;format>): date when the attachment was moved with a custom date format string
   * $version: version of the attachment
   * $oldversions: list of old version information in the format =$date;$user;$rev;$comment=
   * $encode(...): helper to url encode the enclosed string
   * $exists: boolean to indicate whether the attachment really exists


The header and footer format strings may only contain
   * $count: the number of attachments found
   * $extensions: comma separated list of all file extensions

The format, header and footer may contain the standard escape sequences:
   * $dollar: $ sign
   * $n: newline
   * $percnt: % sign
   * $quot: " sign

Example:
<verbatim>
%ATTACHMENTS{
  header="| *&nbsp;* | *Name* | *Url* | *Size* | *Author* | $n"
  format="| $idnex | $name: | $url | $sizeK |"
}%
</verbatim>
generates:

<noautolink>
%ATTACHMENTS{
  header="| *#* | *Icon* | *Name* | *Size* | *Author* | *Date* |$n"
  format="| $index | $icon | <a href='$url'>$name</a> | $sizeK | $user | $date |"
}%
</noautolink>
